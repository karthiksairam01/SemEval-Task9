      ""Because of the potential for foodborne illness, we urge consumers
      to check to see if they have purchased any of these products,"" said
      Thomas J. Billy, FSIS administrator. ""If they find the recalled
      products, consumers should not eat them, but return them to the point of
      purchase. Consumers may also wish to ask delis and restaurants if
      purchased products are subject to the recall.""
      The problem was discovered through illnesses identified by state health
      departments and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention. FSIS and the CDC are currently studying these illnesses. While
      the study is ongoing, Cargill is recalling the products based on a
      preliminary analysis of epidemiological data. Anyone concerned about an
      illness should contact a physician.
      Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause
      listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. Healthy people
      rarely contract listeriosis. Listeriosis can cause high fever, severe
      headache, neck stiffness, and nausea. Listeriosis can also cause
      miscarriages and stillbirths, as well as serious and sometimes fatal
      infections in those with weak immune systems--infants, the frail or
      elderly, and persons with chronic disease, with HIV infection, or taking
      chemotherapy.
      Consumers with questions about the recall may contact Cargill Turkey

      Information is also available on the companys website at http://www.plantation-foods.com.
      Media with questions may contact Mark Klein, Cargill communication
      manager, at (254) 412-3478. Media with questions about illnesses can

    LISTERIA PRECAUTIONS
      People at risk for
    listeriosis and their family members or individuals preparing food for them should:
    Reheat until steaming hot the following
    types of ready-to-eat foods: hot dogs, luncheon meats, cold cuts, fermented and dry
    sausage, and other deli-style meat and poultry products. Thoroughly reheating food can
    help kill any bacteria that might be present. If you cannot reheat these foods, do not eat
    them. 
    Wash hands with hot, soapy water after
    handling these types of ready-to-eat foods. (Wash for at least 20 seconds.) Also wash
    cutting boards, dishes, and utensils. Thorough washing helps eliminate any bacteria that
    might get on your hands or other surfaces from food before it is reheated. 
    Do not eat soft cheeses such as feta, Brie,
    Camembert, blue-veined or Mexican-style cheese. You can eat hard cheeses, processed
    cheeses, cream cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt.
    Do not drink raw, unpasteurized milk or eat
    foods made from it, such as unpasteurized cheese. 
    Observe all expiration dates for
    perishable items that are precooked or ready-to-eat.","turkey, chicken, products, recall, Texas, plant, listeria, contamination, food, hazard.
